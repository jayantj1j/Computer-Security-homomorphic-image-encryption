# Computer-Security-homomorphic-image-encryption
· Implemented **3 homomorphic image encryption algorithms- RSA, Pallier & Gentry(Full)** in Python and
verified their authenticity by doing various image processing operations on the encrypted image.

· Merits of 3 algorithms were compared by analysing image’s intensity histograms,pixel correlation plots and
run-time complexities.
